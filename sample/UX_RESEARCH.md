# UX Research Report

## Research Overview
- **Objective**: Understand user preferences, behaviors, and pain points for word puzzle games to inform development of "Hollow Word" app
- **Methodology**: User interviews, competitive analysis, survey data analysis, behavioral observation
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks of research (interviews, surveys, competitive analysis)
- **Participants**: 25 participants aged 18-65, mix of casual and dedicated puzzle game players

## Key Findings
### User Needs
1. **Quick Mental Stimulation**: Users want 2-5 minute brain exercises that can fit into busy schedules (commute, breaks, waiting)
2. **Progressive Difficulty**: Players need sense of progression from easy warm-ups to challenging puzzles
3. **Social Competition**: 78% want to compare scores/progress with friends and family
4. **Offline Capability**: 65% play during commutes/travel where internet is unreliable

### Pain Points
